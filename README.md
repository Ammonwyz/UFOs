At the bottom of the page, we have our searching table. The table can help us to filte the data by city, date, country and shape.


## Summary: 

In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

Drawback:

The downside of this site is that it is limited by the design of search engines. For example: to search for a city name, you must first know the exact full name of the city, even case-sensitive.

Recommendations:

1. The city searching is too limited. The search scope of city names should be relaxed, for example, related cities can be searched by one word.


2. The date can only filte by date, cannot list by month or year. The date search range should also give users more options, such as searching by "year" or "month", instead of just searching for the standard format of day/ month/ year.
